# Interactive Sketchfab geological model viewer 

https://kyleedwardbradley.github.io/3d-geo-viewer/index.html

This model viewer allows interactive hiding and showing of objects based on material names, adjustment of transparency, and switching between models given as a list of Sketchfab UIDs.

The UIDs are stored in a local JSON file: ./uid_list.json

This viewer is heavily modified from https://github.com/ricoshae/sketchfabhideandshow by Chris Richter (chris@ricoshae.com.au)
